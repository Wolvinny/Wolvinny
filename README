[WIP]

Hi, i'm wolvinny,
I'm a software developer in my free time. I am experienced in NodeJS and typescript, but also Java.
Coding is not my main focus, nor do i plan to make it more than a hobby

In my regular day to day life i currently am in my last year of college, after that i'll get enrolled into everything that has to do with drones, whether its flying them, maintaining them, filing flight plans, etc.
I have a mostly aviation background, but ive chosen for drones.

Most things i've coded are private discord bots, and some small minecraft plugins.
I own https://we-dont.care and https://we-dont-fucking.care , along with https://wolvinny.dev and https://treble-is-fluffy.gay, the latter just as a cdn.
I dont really havbe frontend experience so these sites are mostly empty
