[WIP]
### Some of my projects might be murrsuit related / NSFW, please be aware

Hi, i'm wolvinny, a 20yo fluffy corgi.
I fursuit in my free time, and I'm a software developer in whatever thats left of my free time. I am experienced in NodeJS and TypeScript, but also Java.
Coding is not my main focus, nor do i plan to make it more than a hobby; it merely is a free time activity.

In my regular day to day life i currently am in my last year of college, after that i'll get enrolled into everything that has to do with drones, whether its flying them, maintaining them, filing flight plans, etc.
I have a mostly aviation background, but ive chosen for drones, though i am planning to get my PPL.

Most things i've coded are private discord bots, and some small minecraft plugins.
I own https://we-dont.care and https://we-dont-fucking.care , along with https://wolvinny.dev and https://treble-is-fluffy.gay, the latter just as a cdn.
I dont really have frontend experience, nor time to learn it, so these sites are mostly empty or even just non functional since the host they were on shut down and i dont have time to transfer it to cf pages
