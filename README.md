[WIP]
### Some of my projects might be murrsuit related / NSFW, please be aware

Hi, i'm wolvinny, or Luna, a 21yo fluffy corgi.
I fursuit in my free time, and I'm a software developer in whatever thats left of my free time. I am experienced in NodeJS and TypeScript, but also Java.
Coding is not my main focus, nor do i plan to make it more than a hobby; it merely is a free time activity.

In my regular day to day life i am a fulltime service engineer / technician, and doing stuff ranging from regular inspections in factories, on ships, on chemical plants, etc, to inspections on offshore windmills.
I have a mostly aviation background, but ive chosen for drones, though i am planning to get my PPL.

Most things i've coded are private discord bots, and some small minecraft plugins.
I own https://we-dont.care and https://we-dont-fucking.care , along with https://wolvinny.dev and https://treble-is-fluffy.gay, the latter just as a cdn.
I dont really have frontend experience, nor time to learn it, so these sites are mostly empty or even just non functional since the host they were on shut down and i dont have time to transfer it to cf pages
